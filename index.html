            <p>Hello! My name is Craig Rich and I am from Deltona, Florida. I enjoy cooking and reading. I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 2002-2004 in the Taipei, Taiwan Mission. I went to BYU Provo to get my first degree in psychology. Turns out that a degree in psychology is barely worth the paper it's printed on. Needing a good career, I went to my local community collge in Florida and became a registered nurse in 2017. I worked with mental health patients for about five years. Now I work in a prison taking care of inmates. I desire another career change, so I'm back to school studying computer science. Hopefully, third time's the charm.</p>
