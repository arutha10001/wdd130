            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>The purpose of the website is to bring in new customers with our new website, which will also make advertising and bookings easier. It will provide information about available white water rafting experiences through our company White Water Adventures. Access to this information will generate interest and help customers customize their rafting experience. Our website will also bring awareness of rafting to those who have not been exposed to this recreational activity. Furthermore, it will educate potential customers on the history of white water rafting, the tools needed for the activity, the skills fostered by rafting, and recommendations on how to get started. Customers will be able to reserve dates, equipment, hire a river guide, recommendations for hotels or camping sites in the area, and customize their white water rafting experience. There will be pictures and videos of people participating in rafting, as well as testimonials from previous customers. Finally, the website will contact information to White Water Adventures for general information, reservations, and customer service. By increasing awareness of our business and creating ease of access, we increase profits.</p>
